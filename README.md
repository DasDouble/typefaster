Keyboard Typefaster
This Python script listens to keyboard input and checks for valid English words in the entered text. It uses the keyboard library to capture keypress events and the enchant library to validate words against an English dictionary.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
keyboard library (install using pip install keyboard)
enchant library (install using pip install pyenchant)
Usage
Run the script by executing python word_checker.py in the terminal.
Start typing in any text.
Press the space key to check for valid words in the entered text.
The script will print the entered text, generated permutations of the text, and the first valid English word found.
Press the backspace key to delete the last character in the entered text.
Press the esc key to exit the program.
Feel free to modify the script according to your needs and explore different functionalities. Happy coding!
